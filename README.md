# CV Prediction Project Using NLP

This repository contains a project focused on predicting job profiles from resumes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to automate the process of resume screening by classifying resumes into predefined job categories.



## Features

-  Utilizes the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text processing tasks, including tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, to clean and prepare resume text data for analysis.

- TF-IDF Vectorization: Employs Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to convert textual data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.
